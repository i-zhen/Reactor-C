# Part I : Parsing
The goal of part I is to write a lexical and syntactic analyser - a parser - for a subset of C.
As you have learnt in the course, parsing consists of three parts:

1. Scanner: the job of the scanner is to read the input file one character at a time.
2. Lexer: the lexer transforms the stream of characters into a stream of tokens. These tokens represents the lexem (i.e. a word in natural languages)
3. Parser: the parser finally consumes the tokens and determine if the input conforms to the rule of the grammar.

The scanner has already been implemented for you and we provide some partial implementations of the lexer and parser.
You will have to implement the rest.
We strongly encourage you to write a recursive descent parser and as such make your grammar LL(k).
We have provided utility function in the parser class to allow look ahead.


## 1. Lexing
The file `Tokeniser.java` contains a partial implementation of a lexer. Your job is to complete the implementation.
In particular, you have to complete the implementation of the method `next` in the `Tokeniser`-class. It is strongly recommended that you fill in the missing details, rather than rolling our own `Lexer` from scratch. Furthermore, do not remove the existing public methods, e.g. `getErrorCount` and `nextToken`. The tokens that your lexer needs to recognise are given in the file `Token.java`. Note that you are **not** allowed to use [the Java regular expression matcher](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html) in your implementation.

Please note that comments should be treated as whitespace. Comments can either be single line:
`// this is a comment`
or multiline
`/* this is a
    multiline comment */`

The "#include" directive should be tokenised into the INCLUDE token. However, you should not do anything with the "include" preprocessor directive (it is completely ignored in the rest of the compiler).
Furthermore, for numbers we consider only integers, and therefore you need not implement support for hexadecimal or octal numbers.

The list of characters to escape are the same as in Java. Please check this [link](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/characters.html) for the full list.

A hint: It is recommended to use the [Character-class methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html) to test whether a character is a digit, whitespace, etc.

## 2. Grammar
Your next job will consists in taking the grammar expressed in EBNF form and transform it into an equivalent context-free LL(k) grammar.
You should make sure that the resulting grammar is non-ambiguous, eliminate left recursion and ensure that the usual precedence rules for arithmetic expression are respected (\*,/,% have precedence over +,-).
For instance, the expression 2\*3+2 should be parsed as (2\*3)+2.


## 3. Parser
After having transformed the grammar into a LL(k)-grammar and implemented the lexer you will have to implement a parser. The parser determines whether a given source program is syntactically correct or incorrect. A partial implementation of a recursive-decent parser has already been provided. The provided `Parser`-class has the following interface:

* `int getErrorCount()` returns the number of parsing errors.
* `void parse()` initiates the parsing of a given source program.

In addition, the `Parser`-class contains various private methods, of which some are ultility methods, e.g.

* `void error(TokenClass... expected)` takes a variable number of expected tokens, and emits an error accordingly.
* `Token lookAhead(int i)` returns the `i`'th token in the token-stream.
* `void nextToken()` advances the token-stream by one, i.e. it consumes one token from the stream.
* `Token expect(TokenClass... expected)` takes a variable number of expected tokens, and consumes them from the token-stream if present, otherwise it generates an error using the `error`-method.
* `boolean accept(TokenClass... expected)` tests whether the next token(s) are identical to the `expected`. However, it *does not* consume any tokens from the token-stream.
* `void parseProgram()` parses a "Program-production" from the LL(k) grammar. Similarly, `void parseIncludes()` parses an "Includes-production". Three additional empty methods have been provided: `parseDecls`, `parseProcs` and `parseMain` are to be completed by you. Furthermore, you will need to add more parse methods yourself. For each nonterminal you should have a corresponding parse method.

Your parser *should* only determine whether a given source program is syntactically correct. The `Main`-class relies on the error count provided by the `Parser`-class. Therefore, make sure you use the `error`-method in the `Parser`-class to report errors correctly!
