# Part IV : Code Generation

The goal of part IV is to write the code generator.
In order to simplify the development of the code generator, we are going to use version 4.2 of the ASM Java ByteCode manipulation library.
We will restrict our-self to the use of the Core API and it is **forbidden** to use the Tree API (do not use any of the classes in the org.objectweb.asm.tree.* packages).

## Scoring

We use two types of tests for marking Part IV, full applications which are given to you in the test folders and small tests which are mostly hidden as in the previous parts.
For calulating the mark for Part IV, the full applications will count for 80% of the mark while the small tests count for 20%. The full applications are:

* cashmachine
* dec2bin
* fibonacci
* factorial
* is_leap_year
* is_palindromic
* is_prime
* pascals_triangle
* tictactoe
* towers_of_hanoi

So, if for instance you are able to compile and run correctly all the small tests but none of the full applications, you will get a mark of 20% for part IV.

## 0. Setup and Learning

You first task will consist of reading the ASM [guide](./asm4-guide.pdf), in particular section 2 and 3.
Use the examples of section 2.2.3 and 3.2.2 to learn how to generate a class and a method using the Core API.
The Javadoc is also available [here](http://asm.ow2.org/asm40/javadoc/user/index.html) (for a slightly older version).

We also recommend that you take a look at the ASMifier tool or the Bytecode Outline plugin for Eclipse which allows you to type Java source code and see the ASM API calls needed in order to produce the corresponding Java ByteCode.
You can find a link to these tools on the main ASM [webpage](http://asm.ow2.org/).

## 1. Generating the Main class

Your next task will consists of producing in your compiler the Main class using the ASM API containing an empty main function with the following signature: `static void main(String[])`.
It is important to ensure that the generated class file is named `Main.class` and located in the `out/` directory for our automated testing system to work correctly.
You should then check that you can correctly execute the class produced by running the `java Main` command in the `out/` directory


## 2. Handling global variable declarations

The next task will consists of writing a visitor which emits all the global variable in your program as static fields in the Main class.

## 3. Handling of procedure declarations

Next, we suggest that you extend your code generator visitor to handle procedure declarations but leave the body empty for now.
All procedures should be statically declared in the class file.

## 4. Generating function code

Finally, you should extend your visitor to handle the actual code found in each method and proceed to generate the corresponding Java ByteCode instructions.

## 5. Handling of built-in functions

We provide an implementation of the built-in functions in the class-file `lib/IO.class`.
You are free to link against this library or write your own.
The source file `lib/IO.java` provided along with the library class.
However, keep in mind that when testing for the output procuded by the program compiled with your compiler, we also check for whitespaces (newline, space, ...), so it is highly advised to use the IO functions.

## Running your compiler
In order to run your compiler you need to supply it with the path to the `asm-all-4.2.jar` as this library is a dependency.
Therefore, you may run your compiler as follows:
```
$ java -cp "bin/:lib/asm-all-4.2.jar" Main -gen tests/fibonacci.c out/Main.class
```
The `-cp` argument instructs the Java run-time to look for classes in `bin`, and where it may find the asm library. The `-gen` argument instructs your compiler to generate code for the `fibonacci`-program; the generated code is written to a file called `Main.class`. Note that on Windows platform you needto use `;` instead of `:`.

## New Files

A new package has been added under `src/gen/`. This package should be used to store your code generator.

 * The `gen.CodeGenerator` is the only class which `Main.java` directly interfaces with. Inside this class you should run your own code generator visitor.
 * The `lib/asm-all-4.2.jar` package contains the version 4.2 of the ASM library that you have to use for implementing the code generator.

## Updated Files

* The `Main.java` has been updated to provide a new commandline pass `-gen` which runs your code generator.
